## Problem 1
```{r}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

The dataset is made of weather data for LGA, JFK, and EWR in early January 2013. It includes data of 15 variables, which are: `r paste(names(early_january_weather), collapse = ", ")`.  
The dataset contains `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns of data.  
The temperature on average during this period of time is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)`

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(early_january_weather, 
       aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5)
```
